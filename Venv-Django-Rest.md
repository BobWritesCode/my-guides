# Set up VENV

This guides is to help set up a virtual environnement.

This works on my current set up:

- Windows 11
- IDE: Visual Studio Code (VSC)
- Python installed locally (3.10 and 3.11)

---

## Creating repository folder

- Create a repository folder.
- Open repository folder in IDE.
- In the terminal you should be in `.../repo_folder/`

---

## Create VENV

- Run these commands in **CMD** terminal in IDE while in repository folder:
  - In **CMD**: `py -m venv VENV_NAME`
    - *example:* `py -m venv venv`

*Tip:* `VENV_NAME` is the virtual environment name. `venv` is commonly used.

---

## Starting / Activating VENV

- While in the repository folder:
  - If using **CMD** terminal,
    - run: `cd venv/Scripts` (Sometimes `cd venv/bin`, normally on Mac)
    - run: `activate`
      - You will now see `(venv)` at beginning of file path in the terminal.
    - run: `cd ../..`
  - If using **Bash** terminal,
    - run: `source venv/Scripts/activate`
      - or if in project directory, if created, you can run: `source ../venv/Scripts/activate`

*Tip:* VENV_NAME is venv environment name from above step.\
*Tip:* Should see (venv) every time hit enter in terminal, to show venv is running.
