# Set up VENV

This guides is to help set up a virtual environnement.

This works on my current set up:

- Windows 11
- IDE: Visual Studio Code (VSC)
- Python installed locally (3.10 and 3.11)

## Creating repository folder

- Create a repository folder.
- Open repository folder in IDE.
- In the terminal you should be in `.../repo_folder/`

## Create VENV

- Run these commands in **CMD** terminal in IDE while in repository folder:
  - In **CMD**: `py -m venv VENV_NAME`
    - *example:* `py -m venv venv`

*Tip:* `VENV_NAME` is the virtual environment name. `venv` is commonly used.

## Starting / Activating VENV

- While in the repository folder:
  - If using **CMD** terminal,
    - run: `cd venv/Scripts` (Sometimes `cd venv/bin`, normally on Mac)
    - run: `activate`
      - You will now see `(venv)` at beginning of file path in the terminal.
    - run: `cd ../..`
  - If using **Bash** terminal,
    - run: `source venv/Scripts/activate`
      - or if in project directory, if created, you can run: `source ../venv/Scripts/activate`

*Tip:* VENV_NAME is venv environment name from above step.\
*Tip:* Should see (venv) every time hit enter in terminal, to show venv is running.

## Install pip

- While in repository folder:
  - In **CMD** terminal run: `py -m pip install --upgrade pip`

## Install Django in VENV

- While in repository folder:
  - In **CMD** terminal run: `py -m pip install django`

## Install Django REST in VENV

- While in repository folder:
  - In **CMD** terminal run: `py -m pip install djangorestframework`

## Create Django project

- While in repository folder:
  - In **CMD** terminal run: `django-admin startproject project_name`
    - `project_name` is project name of your choice, it can be anything.

## Running server

- Make sure you are in your Django project directory: `.../repo_folder/project_name/`.
  - If you are in the repository directory `.../repo_folder/` then do this:
    - In **CMD** terminal run: `cd project_name`
    - You should now be in `.../repo_folder/project_name/`
- In **CMD** terminal run: `py -m manage runserver`

## Tips

Commands will slightly change depending on terminal you are using:

- `pip freeze` to see what is installed inside venv.
- `deactivate` to deactivate venv.

## Common commands

This is just a place where I started to keep track of common commands to help. This is while in the venv environment

**KEY:**

- **(RF)** - While in repo folder `.../repo_folder/`.
- **(PF)** - While in project folder `.../repo_folder/project_name/`.

**Commands:**

- Create Super User
  - **BASH** (PF): `py manage.py createsuperuser`
